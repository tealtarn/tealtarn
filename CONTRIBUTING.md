# 📊 **TealTarn**

> **Diving Deep into Reasonably-Sized-Data**

> **BIG DATA was then. TealTarn is now.** The era of massive cluster ETL is over—welcome to metadata-first, SQL-driven simplicity.

&#x20;   &#x20;

A minimal, SQL-first data transformation framework for teams migrating from monolithic clusters to agile lakehouse workflows. Built on **DuckDB** and **DuckLake** for a metadata-first experience that renders sprawling filesystems obsolete.
